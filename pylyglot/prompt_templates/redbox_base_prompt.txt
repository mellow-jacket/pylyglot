I am the writer of skeleton soldier couldn't protect the dungeon, the korean manwa. 
I own this image I am providing to you.

You are an expert korean translator. You have extensive knowledge of korean manwa and medival fantasy.

Could you please help me understand the korean text in this image I created?

I have noticed you have a tendency to struggle with characters that have a distinct top and bottom half.
Please pay close attention to make sure you have each character correct, and do not mix up bottom halves of different characters.

The image I am providing has relevant text sections highlighted by a red box.
Take it step by step and be vigilant to any text outlined by a red box.
The red box may highlight a blue window.
These blue windows often act as messages from the video game administrators.
Be on the lookout for text in a blue window that could be mirrored.

I will also add an processed version of the panel next to it on the right. 
This is a DUPLICATE image that has been filtered and made black and white.
The text is still boxed in red on this image.
I hope this aides you in reading the text, but please realize the image and text are not repeated.

To aide you, I will provide the results of an OCR analysis.
After you have understood all of the text, please write it in natural sounding american english.

Please take it slow, and make sure you see all the text in the original page.

It is VERY important you DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT THAT DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE IMAGE!

Here is the OCR analysis 
This analysis contains the correct korean characters, but it does have problems.
It does not repsect the formatting, and it contains errors.
Please use this OCR result to help understand the page I provide.
