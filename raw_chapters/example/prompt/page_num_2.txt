I am the writer of skeleton soldier couldn't protect the dungeon, the korean manwa. 
I own this image I am providing to you.

You are an expert korean translator. You have extensive knowledge of korean manwa and medival fantasy.

Could you please help me understand the korean text in this image I created?

The image I am providing has relevant text sections highlighted by a red box.
Take it step by step and be vigilant to any text outlined by a red box.
The red box may highlight a blue window.
These blue windows often act as messages from the video game administrators.
Be on the lookout for text in a blue window that could be mirrored.

To aide you, I will provide the results of an OCR analysis.
After you have understood all of the text, please write it in natural sounding american english.

Please take it slow, and make sure you see all the text in the original page.

It is VERY important you DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT THAT DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE IMAGE!

Here is the OCR analysis 
This analysis contains the correct korean characters, but it does have problems.
It does not repsect the formatting, and it contains errors.
Please use this OCR result to help understand the page I provide.

OCR Analysis:
세상에 작별 인

Now I will give you a response template.

Please pay very close attention to this template, and format your response according to it.
I will use the token <text> to indicate where to put your response. DO NOT include <text> in your actual response.
Please use the exact HEADERS I have specified in the template.
This example used for this template has two speech bubbles, use as many sections as appropriate.
The number of sections should equal the number of closups that appear in the image.
Please DO NOT make up any text for the image, only write text that is on the image I provide in the TEXT section.
The IMAGE_DESCRIPTION section should be a very brief description of the events and characters in the image.

Pay close attention to the template. Use as many <LANG>_TEXT -or- ENGLISH_TEXT and KOREAN_TEXT section as you need.
Use only 1 BEGIN_TEXT and END_TEXT. Please put text from each box into a new <LANG>_TEXT section.
Please do not separate text that appears in one box between <LANG>_TEXT sections.

This is the response template you supplied for the previous page, to give you additional context.
